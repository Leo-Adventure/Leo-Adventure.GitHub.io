        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>I am a junior at the Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), majoring in Computer Science
          and Technology, and studying in the Turing class of my major. I am currently on an exchange program at the
          University of California, Berkeley, from January to May of this year, during which I took <b>computer vision,
            deep learning, machine learning, and operating system</b>. I am seeking a summer research opportunity in
          machine learning. My goal is to apply my machine learning skills and knowledge to contribute to cutting-edge
          research and learn from experts in the field.
          <br />
          I have a strong interest in machine learning and deep learning, and I have been working in our <a
            href="https://www.imed-lab.com">iMED lab</a> since
          the first semester of my sophomore year to study the application of deep learning to medical imaging. <b>As a
            proactive and dedicated researcher, I led my group to achieve A's in both semesters of the research course,
            which was recognized by the grading professors.</b> I have also represented the university and achieved good
          results in the international supercomputing competitions of HPC-AI and ASC22.
          <br />
          My overall GPA is 3.74/4, and my sophomore GPA is 3.83/4 and my junior GPA is 3.94/4. <b>I have completed almost all the major courses required for graduation and earned A and A+ in
            Machine Learning, Probability and Mathematical Statistics, Software Engineering and Computer Operating
            Systems, etc.</b> I have also been a student assistant for two semesters in C/C++ Programming and Computer
          Networks. My skills include proficiency in programming languages such as Python, Java, and C++, as well as
          experience in deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch.
