        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>My name is Mingqian Liao, I'm a senior undergraduate at the Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), majoring in Computer Science
          and Technology, and studying in the Turing class of my major. I am currently a undergraduate research assistant at the Johns Hopkins University, under the guidance of Prof. Vishal M. Patel. <b>I am looking for a phd position in computer vision after getting my bachelor degree in 2024.</b> My goal is to apply my deep learning skills and knowledge to contribute to cutting-edge
          research in the field.
          <br /><br />
          I love coding and I have a strong interest in computer vision and deep learning, and I am currently working on NeRF project in the <a
          href="https://engineering.jhu.edu/vpatel36/">VIU lab</a> in JHU. And I have been working in our <a
            href="https://www.imed-lab.com">iMED lab</a> in SUSTech for two year to study the application of deep learning and computer vision to medical imaging processing. 
          <br /><br />

          I am eager to delve into the field of computer vision, aiming to uncover the underlying algorithms that drive our visual perception and recognition. As a student focused on computer vision, I hope to provide fresh insights into the advancements of image recognition and artificial intelligence technologies.

          <br /><br/>
          Outside of my academic interests, I enjoy photographing, travelling and cooking.
